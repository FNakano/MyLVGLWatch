Welcome to MyLVGLWatch's documentation!

What is this?
-------------

This is a personal activity annotator built on a programmable wristwatch. 

The watch owner selects, through watch's touchscreen, what activity is starting. The selected activity, date and time of the activity is recorded. The records can be seen on any device with a web browser and wifi connection. (Detailed information in `How to use the personal activity annotator`).

It is a sort of DIY device (no warranties and some work to get it going ðŸ™‚ ).

How to get one
--------------

with minimum downloads and tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Get a TTGO T-Watch (tested with 2020 v.3) programmable watch;
- Get a desktop computer to program the watch;
- On the desktop, install ``esptool`` (this is the tool to send the program to the watch);
- On the desktop, download the files in ``bin`` (These are the personal activity annotator program in binary format);
- Connect the watch to the desktop with a USB data cable;
- Open the terminal, send the program with the command: ``python3 /home/fabio/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/3.3.0/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 2000000 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB 0x1000 /tmp/arduino_build_299108/MyLvglWatch-20220910.ino.bootloader.bin 0x8000 /tmp/arduino_build_299108/MyLvglWatch-20220910.ino.partitions.bin 0xe000 /home/fabio/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/2.0.4/tools/partitions/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 /tmp/arduino_build_299108/MyLvglWatch-20220910.ino.bin``

with development environment installation 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Get a TTGO T-Watch (tested with 2020 v.3) programmable watch;
- Get a desktop computer to program the watch;
- On the desktop, install ``Arduino IDE`` with support to ``ESP32`` board. (this is the tool to send the program to the watch);
   - some help with Arduino IDE: https://github.com/FNakano/CFA/tree/master/programas/arduinoIDE (Brazilian Portuguese)
   - some help with ESP32 support: https://github.com/FNakano/CFA/tree/master/componentes/controladores/ESP#configurar-arduinoide-para-programar-o-esp8266-ou-o-esp32 (Brazilian Portuguese) 
- On the desktop, download the files in ``src`` (These are the personal activity annotator program in binary format);
- Open the file ``MyLvglWatch20220910.ino`` with ``Arduino IDE``;
   - it probably will move the files to a new folder;
- Connect the watch to the desktop with a USB data cable;
- In tools menu select port (e.g. /dev/ttyACM0);
- In boards menu select ``TTGO T-Watch``;
- In tools menu select partition scheme: Large SPIFFS;
- In tools menu select ESP32 Sketch Data Upload;
   - this will send data (web pages) to your watch;
- Click on the arrow button;
   - this compiles the source-code and sends the binaries through USB.

My documentation project milestones
-----------------------------------

- Target zero: know what is this;
- Target 1: deploy the test explained above;
   - binaries and esptool (fastest if you don't have Arduino IDE installed and configured - just try this test case on your watch);
   - Arduino IDE, source-code download, compile and deploy (recommended if you want to program the watch);
- Target 2: learn what was done (and the underlying ideas);
- Target 3: learn how to expand it;
- Target 4: learn how to create the github repository and the RTD documentation
